        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>What is Zuppa Toscana, you ask?</p>

        <p>So, “zuppa” means soup in Italian. “Toscana” refers to the Tuscany region of Italy. Therefore, “Zuppa Toscana” translates to “Tuscan soup” or “Tuscan-style soup.” Traditionally, this soup is made with lots of veggies, beans, potatoes, olive oil, spices, Italian bacon, and Tuscan bread (it kind of reminds me of a minestrone).</p>

        <p>The American version though adds Italian sausage and bacon, garlic, and heavy cream in addition to the potatoes and kale. While the American version might be a little on the heavier side, this soup eats like a meal, <strong>believe me!</strong></p>
        
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

        <p><ul>
            <li><strong>1 pound</strong> spicy Italian ground sausage</li>
            <li><strong>4 tablespoons</strong> butter</li>
            <li><strong>1/2</strong> white onion, <em>diced</em></li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> minced garlic</li>
            <li><strong>6 cups</strong> chicken broth</li>
            <li><strong>2 cups</strong> water</li>
            <li><strong>4-5</strong> yellow potatoes - cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li><strong>3 teaspoons</strong> salt - or to taste</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>2 cups</strong> heavy cream</li>
            <li><strong>4 cups</strong> chopped kale</li>

        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        
        <p><ol>
            
            <p><li>In a large pot saute sausage 5-6 minutes until browned. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sausage to a plate and set aside. </li></p>

            <p><li>In the same pot, add butter and saute onions over medium heat until translucent. Add garlic and saute for another minute until fragrant.</li></p>

            <p><li>Add chicken broth, water, potatoes, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Boil until potatoes are tender. Stir in kale, and heavy cream. Add sausage. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed. Serve garnished with grated parmesan cheese and/or bacon if desired. </li></p>
