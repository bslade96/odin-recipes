        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>I was really torn whether to classify this as an <em>appetizer</em> or <em>entree.</em></p>

        <p>I could (and I have) eaten most of the platter, alone, so that made it my dinner. But then I have also served this to some friends and family, which means I had to share so it unfortunately became an appetizer.</p>

        <p>So I guess it's both?</p>

        <p>I donâ€™t know. Either way, app or entree, these super crispy, crunchy taquitos comes together in a cinch with the help of leftover rotisserie along with a few pantry staples and my favorite blend of cheeses. Simply fill them up, roll them, and throw them in some hot, hot oil until super golden brown and crisp.</p>

        <p>Serve with guacamole, pico de gallo and a dollop of sour cream. <strong>SO SO GOOD.</strong></p>
