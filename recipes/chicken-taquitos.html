        <p><h2 class="header">Description</h2></p>

        <p>I was really torn whether to classify this as an <em>appetizer</em> or <em>entree.</em></p>

        <p>I could (and I have) eaten most of the platter, alone, so that made it my dinner. But then I have also served this to some friends and family, which means I had to share so it unfortunately became an appetizer.</p>

        <p>So I guess it's both?</p>

        <p>I donâ€™t know. Either way, app or entree, these super crispy, crunchy taquitos comes together in a cinch with the help of leftover rotisserie along with a few pantry staples and my favorite blend of cheeses. Simply fill them up, roll them, and throw them in some hot, hot oil until super golden brown and crisp.</p>

        <p>Serve with guacamole, pico de gallo and a dollop of sour cream. <strong>SO SO GOOD.</strong></p>

        <p><h2 class ="header">Ingredients</h2></p>
        
        <p><ul>
            <li><strong>3 cups</strong> leftover shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> 4-ounce can diced green chilies</li>
            <li><strong>4 ounces</strong> extra-sharp cheddar cheese, <em>shredded</em></li>
            <li><strong>4 ounces</strong> Pepper Jack cheese, <em>shredded</em></li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
            <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> chili powder</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> ground cumin</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> hot sauce, <em>or more, to taste</em></li>
            <li><strong>12</strong> 6-inch corn tortillas, warmed</li>
            <li><strong>6 cups</strong> canola oil</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2 class="header">Steps</h2></p>
        
        <p><ol>
            <p><li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, green chiles, cheeses, cilantro, chili powder, cumin and hot sauce.</li></p>

            <p><li>Working one at a time, transfer tortilla to a work surface; place 1/3 cup chicken mixture in the center of each wrapper. Bring the bottom edge of the tortilla tightly over the filling, rolling from bottom to top until the top of the tortilla is reached; secure with wooden picks. Repeat with remaining tortilla and filling.</li></p>

            <p><li>Heat canola oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat until it reaches 375 degrees F.</li></p>

            <p><li>Working in batches, add taquitos to the Dutch oven and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. When cool enough to handle, remove wooden picks.</li></p>

            <p><li>Serve immediately.</li></p>
