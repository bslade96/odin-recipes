# odin-recipes

Hey everyone!

This is my very first project and I am  so excited to showcase what I have learned so far through The Odin Project! For this assignment I am creating a recipe website. By the end of the project I will have demonstrated how to create the structure of the website with content such as basic text, absolute and relatives links, and images containing alternative texts. I will have presented how I used text-based elements to alter specific text on web pages and how I created ordered lists for the recipes' instructions.
